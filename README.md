Build your own knowledge base and get accurate information using WikiTalk!

## App Overview üîç

Welcome to WikiTalk, where the power of OpenAI's GPT technology is at your fingertips. With WikiTalk, you can ask questions and get accurate information based on Wikipedia. 

As we know, chatGPT sometimes give wrong answers based on users' questions, because GPT-3.5's last knowledge update is in January 2022, which means it can't provide real-time information.

Our system uses the power of GPT-3.5-Turbo and real_time Wikipedia to provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information available. Whether you're looking for information on a specific topic, or just want to learn something new, WikiTalk is here to help. So go ahead, ask us anything!

## Features of the App üéØ
- **WikiTalk**:  You can ask questions and get accurate information based on Wikipedia here. Before using this function, you need to add the related data using 'Knowledge Base' function, otherwise you will get the feedback from chatGPT-3.5 directly that might be wrong. And it might take 1-2minutes to get the feedback because it will search all the relevant information in your knowledge base.
- **Knowledge Base**:  Here you can add the related data to the knowledge base to build your own library. Using search, add, read and delete to modify your library.
- **File Chat**:  You can upload a PDF file here and ask questions about the file.
- **GPT Clone**: You can chat with the chatGPT-3.5 directly here. This chatbot does not use the knowledge base data, so it might be wrong.
